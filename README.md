# hnchat
The original design of the chatbox is not by me; it's mirrored from Metastruct's chatbox. I personally enjoyed the design of it, and tried to mimmick it in my own way.

**This chatbox is not finished**; not yet, atleast

## Built-in Features
* Local chat: Talk with players in an area of 256 in-game units.
* DM system: Send private messages to players in the game.
* Partial Chatsounds support (tab in chat for autocomplete)
